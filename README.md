## 🧠 Overview
**Voice Over Vision Assistant (VOVA)** is an innovative AI-powered tool designed to empower visually challenged individuals by providing real-time assistance through voice interactions.

VOVA seamlessly integrates cutting-edge AI technologies, including **Whisper**, **LLaMA 3**, and **Gemini models**, leveraging APIs from **Groq** and **Google’s Generative AI**. By processing multi-modal inputs such as voice commands and webcam-captured images, VOVA delivers accurate and context-aware audio responses, making it an indispensable tool for navigating the world without relying on sight.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Voice Input**: Users speak commands, transcribed to text using Whisper.  
2. **Image Capture (Optional)**: VOVA captures and analyzes images using Gemini upon request.  
3. **AI-Powered Response**: LLaMA 3 processes the text/image and generates a relevant response.  
4. **Audio Output**: Google Text-to-Speech converts the response into real-time audio feedback.
